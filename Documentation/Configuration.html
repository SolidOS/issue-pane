<h1>Issue Tracker configuration</h1>
<p>The Solid issue tracker system, <code>issue-pane</code>, is a
very flexible system which can be configured for many different
needs. Therefore, understanding the format of the configuration
file is important, as currently, there is no User Interface support
for a user to configure a new tracker herself.</p>
<p>The words 'issue' and 'task' may be used interchangeably in this
document and in the software. Note that you may end up using the
tracker for things where you don't think of them as "issues" - they
may be requests for hand-made craft items, To-Dos, meals to be
organized, and so on.</p>
<p>From the user's point of view, an issue tracker basically is a
list of issues and a tool for editing the details of an issue.</p>
<p>To make an instance of tracker on a solid pod, just create the
main config file and go to the URI of the tracker in a browser, and
the data bowser will run the code you need. Other solid-compatible
tracker tools may also be built to use the same data.</p>
<p>The classes and properties in this document at in the Workflow
namespace.</p>
<pre>
<code>@prefix wf: 'http://www.w3.org/2005/01/wf/flow#&gt;.</code>
</pre>
<p>You may find other namespaces useful, such as</p>
<pre>
<code>@prefix cal: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/ical#&gt;.
@prefix link: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/link#&gt;.
@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;.
@prefix owl: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt;.
@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;.
@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;.
@prefix doap: &lt;http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#&gt;.
@prefix ui: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ui#&gt;.
@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;.
@prefix vcard: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#&gt;.</code>
</pre>
<p>Typically, (and currently) a tracker has one config file, say
<code>index.ttl</code> one file to actually store the state of all
the issues, say <code>state.ttl</code>, and optionally one file to
store chat messages, say <code>chat.ttl</code> if you don't want
them to be in the same file as the issues themselves.</p>
<p>You should <em>create empty files</em> for the state and chat
file. Then create the tracker config file and you are done.</p>
<p>Your config file will start by defining the Tracker object
itself.</p>
<p>A common way is to create a new Solid folder for the tracker,
and in that make the config file <code>index.ttl</code> and the
tracker object <code>index.ttl#this</code> . Then the solid file
bowser will display the folder as a tracker object. So let's do
that in this example.</p>
<pre>
<code>    @prefix : &lt;#&gt;.    # Local identifiers use default namespace
    :this a wf:Tracker;
         dc:title "Issue Tracker for the Foo project" ;
         wf:stateStore &lt;state.ttl&gt; .
         wf:messageStore &lt;chat.ttl&gt; .</code>
</pre>
<h2>Defining possible issue states</h2>
<p>An issue is always in one of a number of states, like Open or
Closed, for a simple system, for a more complex one, say, New,
Assigned, InProgress, Pending External Feedback, Rejected, Done.
Moving an issue from one state to another is the most fundamental
thing users do. The RDFS Class system is used for the issue
state.</p>
<p>The simplest way is to just use the predefined class
<code>wf:Task</code>. It is defined in the ontology to have two
subclasses, <code>wf:Open</code> and <code>wf:Closed</code>.</p>
<pre>
<code># hmmmm
:this wf:stateClass wf:Task;
   wf:initialState wf:Open .</code>
</pre>
<p>The more complex way is to defined your own state classes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a superclass, say <code>FooIssue</code></li>
<li>Define each subclass as being subclasses of
<code>FooIssue</code></li>
<li>Declare the superclass to be a disjoint union of the
subclasses. That means that a task can only be in one at a
time.</li>
<li>For some, but not all, of your subclasses, define them to be a
subclass of <code>wf:Open</code>. These will be the open issues. By
default, only open issues are displayed.</li>
<li>Optionally, define a <code>ui:backgroundColor</code> for each
subclass to make them stand out from each other.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Defining categories</h2>
<p>Depending on what sort of application the tracker is being used
for, it may be useful to categorize issues along one or more axes.
For example, they could be classified by the sort of issue, between
Urgent Fix, Bug, Enhancement Request, Blue Sky Idea. The could be
classified by domain, such as Sales, Marketing, or Engineering, or
product line, and so on.</p>
<p>A category is defined as a set of disjoint classes used in the
issue state above, but then specified using the
<code>issueCategory</code> property.</p>
<pre>
<code>  :this wf:issueCategory :BugType, :Division .</code>
</pre>
<p>This will generate two columns, one for Bug Type, and one for
Division, in the issue list.</p>
<h2>Nested issues</h2>
<p>You can run the tracker in a mode in which issues can have
sub-issues. There is a button on each issue to create sub-issues,
and a list of sub-issues. You can turn this on with a boolean
flag:</p>
<pre>
<code>:this wf:allowSubIssues true .</code>
</pre>
<h2>What's in an issue?</h2>
<p>Any issue will have, anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li>A title</li>
<li>A text description</li>
<li>Its creation date</li>
<li>its state, like Open/Closed.</li>
<li>a text status field about it</li>
<li>A small chat thread</li>
<li>a place to drag related things like web pages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Predicate List</h3>
<p>You can also add to this in two ways. One is with an arbitrary
list of other properties to be displayed in the table</p>
<pre>
<code>  :this wf:propertyList ( dc:title  ex:location ) .</code>
</pre>
<h3>Extras entry form</h3>
<p>The other is by defining a form to be added to the issue
editor</p>
<pre>
<code>  :this wf:extrasEntryForm  :FooDetailsForm .</code>
</pre>
<p>See <a href=
"https://solid.github.io/solid-ui/Documentation/forms-intro.html">Instructions
for creating forms</a></p>
<h2>Managing Assignees</h2>
<p>Optionally, the tracker will let you assign tasks to people. (Or
groups, organizations, etc, but typically people).</p>
<p>To make this happen, you can define the set of people who can
potentially be assigned in either or both of two ways:</p>
<h3>Assignee project:</h3>
<p>Mention in the config file that a DOAP project has the tracker
as its bug tracker.</p>
<pre>
<code>      :FooProject doap:bug-database :this .</code>
</pre>
<p>In the project's rdf document (which may be the same as the
tracker or may be different) give (at least) the developers and
their names.</p>
<pre>
<code>      :FooProject doap:developer  :Alice, :Bob, :Charlie .
      :Alice foaf:name "Alice Accacia".
      :Bob foaf:name "Bob Brown".
      :Charlie foaf:name "Robert Crimson".</code>
</pre>
<h3>Assignee group (new, untested)</h3>
<p>You can create or link to VCARD group of people. The group must
specify the people linked by <code>vcard:member</code></p>
<pre>
<code>    :this  wf:assigneeGroup :Devs .
      :Devs a vcard:Group; vcard:fn "The dream team";
            vcard:member :Alice, :Bob, :Charlie .
            :Alice foaf:name "Alice Accacia".
            :Bob foaf:name "Bob Brown".
            :Charlie foaf:name "Robert Crimson".</code>
</pre>
<p>You can have more than one assignee group. You can have an
associated project, with its developers, as well. All the
developers mentioned will be available to be allocated to
issues.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This issue tracker originally was basically a copy pf the
functionality of Roundup
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup<em>(issue</em>tracker) a
python-based configurable issue tracker we were using before for
the group. Roundup is, for example, used for the python language
itself.</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>Currently (2019-09) there is no user interface tooling for
guiding the user through the task of creating a new tracker. This
would clearly be valuable! @@ link to isssue. Help would be great
in making that.</p>
<p>The current method of storing all the issues in one file works
for small projects but clearly doesn't scale with size or time. A
plan is to use a <code>issueURITemplate</code> to allow issues to
placed in subfolders by date, or timestamp, etc.</p>
<p>A virtual tracker is a tracker which aggregates a view of
several different tracker would be valuable, for example to
aggregate all the issues I have been assigned to, whichever of the
projects</p>
