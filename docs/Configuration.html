    <h1>Issue Tracker configuration</h1>
    <p>
      The Solid issue tracker system, <code>issue-pane</code>, is a very
      flexible system which can be configured for many different needs.
      Therefore, understanding the format of the configuration file is
      important, as currently, there is no User Interface support for a user to
      configure a new tracker herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words 'issue' and 'task' may be used interchangeably in this document
      and in the software. Note that you may end up using the tracker for things
      where you don't think of them as "issues" - they may be requests for
      hand-made craft items, To-Dos, meals to be organized, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the user's point of view, an issue tracker basically is a list of
      issues and a tool for editing the details of an issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make an instance of tracker on a solid pod, just create the main config
      file and go to the URI of the tracker in a browser, and the data bowser
      will run the code you need. Other solid-compatible tracker tools may also
      be built to use the same data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The classes and properties in this document at in the Workflow namespace.
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>@prefix wf: 'http://www.w3.org/2005/01/wf/flow#&gt;.</code>
</pre>
    <p>You may find other namespaces useful, such as</p>
    <pre>
<code>@prefix cal: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/ical#&gt;.
@prefix link: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/link#&gt;.
@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;.
@prefix owl: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt;.
@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;.
@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;.
@prefix doap: &lt;http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#&gt;.
@prefix ui: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ui#&gt;.
@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;.
@prefix vcard: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#&gt;.</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Typically, (and currently) a tracker has one config file, say
      <code>index.ttl</code> one file to actually store the state of all the
      issues, say <code>state.ttl</code>, and optionally one file to store chat
      messages, say <code>chat.ttl</code> if you don't want them to be in the
      same file as the issues themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should <em>create empty files</em> for the state and chat file. Then
      create the tracker config file and you are done.
    </p>
    <p>Your config file will start by defining the Tracker object itself.</p>
    <p>
      A common way is to create a new Solid folder for the tracker, and in that
      make the config file <code>index.ttl</code> and the tracker object
      <code>index.ttl#this</code> . Then the solid file bowser will display the
      folder as a tracker object. So let's do that in this example.
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>    @prefix : &lt;#&gt;.    # Local identifiers use default namespace
    :this a wf:Tracker;
         dc:title "Issue Tracker for the Foo project" ;
         wf:stateStore &lt;state.ttl&gt; .
         wf:messageStore &lt;chat.ttl&gt; .</code>
</pre>
    <h2>Defining possible issue states</h2>
    <p>
      An issue is always in one of a number of states, like Open or Closed, for
      a simple system, for a more complex one, say, New, Assigned, InProgress,
      Pending External Feedback, Rejected, Done. Moving an issue from one state
      to another is the most fundamental thing users do. The RDFS Class system
      is used for the issue state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplest way is to just use the predefined class <code>wf:Task</code>.
      It is defined in the ontology to have two subclasses,
      <code>wf:Open</code> and <code>wf:Closed</code>.
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>:this wf:stateClass wf:Task;
   wf:initialState wf:Open .</code>
</pre>
    <p>The more complex way is to defined your own state classes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Define a superclass, say <code>FooIssue</code></li>
      <li>Define each subclass as being subclasses of <code>FooIssue</code></li>
      <li>
        Declare the superclass to be a disjoint union of the subclasses. That
        means that a task can only be in one at a time.
      </li>
      <li>
        For some, but not all, of your subclasses, define them to be a subclass
        of <code>wf:Open</code>. These will be the open issues. By default, only
        open issues are displayed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optionally, define a <code>ui:backgroundColor</code> for each subclass
        to make them stand out from each other.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <pre>
<code>    :this wf:stateClass :FooIssue ;
        wf:initialState :New.

    :FooIssue a s:Class; s:subClassOf wf:Task;
        s:label "Request";
        owl:disjointUnionOf (
            :New :Discussing :Pending :Negotiating :Accepted :Urgent :ToBeDeclined
            :Declined :Obsolete: Done ).

    :New a s:Class; s:subClassOf :FooIssue, wf:Open; s:label "new"; ui:sortOrder 90;
        s:comment """Has not been looked at.
        This is the initial state normally when an issue is created.""".
    :Discussing a s:Class; s:subClassOf :FooIssue, wf:Open; s:label "in discussion"; ui:sortOrder 80;
        s:comment "Being discussed".
    :Pending a s:Class; s:subClassOf :FooIssue, wf:Open; s:label "pending others"; ui:sortOrder 75;
        s:comment "Waiting for an external person's input.".
    :Negotiating a s:Class; s:subClassOf :FooIssue, wf:Open; s:label "negotiating"; ui:sortOrder 60;
        s:comment "Being negotiated".
    :Accepted a s:Class; s:subClassOf :FooIssue, wf:Open; s:label "Accepted, in progress"; ui:sortOrder 50;
        s:comment "Will go ahead. We are working on this".
    :Urgent a s:Class; s:subClassOf :FooIssue, wf:Open; s:label "URGENT"; ui:sortOrder 55;
        s:comment "Needs urgent attention".
    :ToBeDeclined a s:Class; s:subClassOf :FooIssue, wf:Open; s:label "to be declined"; ui:sortOrder 40;
        s:comment "To be declined".
    :Declined a s:Class; s:subClassOf :FooIssue, wf:Closed; s:label "declined"; ui:sortOrder 30;
        s:comment "Declined".
    :Done a s:Class; s:subClassOf :FooIssue, wf:Closed; s:label "done"; ui:sortOrder 20;
        s:comment "Completed.".
    :Obsolete a s:Class; s:subClassOf :FooIssue, wf:Closed; s:label "obsolete/missed"; ui:sortOrder 10;
        s:comment "Overtaken by time or events.".</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      (Note that the classes must be explicitly subclasses of (indirectly)
      wf:Task as solid-ui/rdflib and maybe others are not smart enough to deduce
      that from the owl:disjointUnionOf.)
    </p>
    <h2>Defining categories</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on what sort of application the tracker is being used for, it
      may be useful to categorize issues along one or more axes. For example,
      they could be classified by the sort of issue, between Urgent Fix, Bug,
      Enhancement Request, Blue Sky Idea. The could be classified by domain,
      such as Sales, Marketing, or Engineering, or product line, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A category is defined as a set of disjoint classes used in the issue state
      above, but then specified using the <code>issueCategory</code> property.
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>  :this wf:issueCategory :BugType, :Division .</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      This will generate two columns, one for Bug Type, and one for Division, in
      the issue list.
    </p>
    <h2>Nested issues</h2>
    <p>
      You can run the tracker in a mode in which issues can have sub-issues.
      There is a button on each issue to create sub-issues, and a list of
      sub-issues. You can turn this on with a boolean flag:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>:this wf:allowSubIssues true .</code>
</pre>
    <h2>What's in an issue?</h2>
    <p>Any issue will have, anyway:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A title</li>
      <li>A text description</li>
      <li>Its creation date</li>
      <li>its state, like Open/Closed.</li>
      <li>a text status field about it</li>
      <li>A small chat thread</li>
      <li>a place to drag related things like web pages</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Predicate List</h3>
    <p>
      You can also add to this in two ways. One is with an arbitrary list of
      other properties to be displayed in the table
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>  :this wf:propertyList ( dc:title  ex:location ) .</code>
</pre>
    <h3>Extras entry form</h3>
    <p>The other is by defining a form to be added to the issue editor</p>
    <pre>
<code>  :this wf:extrasEntryForm  :FooDetailsForm .</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      See
      <a href="https://solid.github.io/solid-ui/Documentation/forms-intro.html"
        >Instructions for creating forms</a
      >
    </p>
    <h2>Managing Assignees</h2>
    <p>
      Optionally, the tracker will let you assign tasks to people. (Or groups,
      organizations, etc, but typically people).
    </p>
    <p>
      To make this happen, you can define the set of people who can potentially
      be assigned in either or both of two ways:
    </p>
    <h3>Assignee project:</h3>
    <p>
      Mention in the config file that a DOAP project has the tracker as its bug
      tracker.
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>      :FooProject doap:bug-database :this .</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      In the project's rdf document (which may be the same as the tracker or may
      be different) give (at least) the developers and their names.
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>      :FooProject doap:developer  :Alice, :Bob, :Charlie .
      :Alice foaf:name "Alice Accacia".
      :Bob foaf:name "Bob Brown".
      :Charlie foaf:name "Robert Crimson".</code>
</pre>
    <h3>Assignee group (new, untested)</h3>
    <p>
      You can create or link to VCARD group of people. The group must specify
      the people linked by <code>vcard:member</code>
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>    :this  wf:assigneeGroup :Devs .
      :Devs a vcard:Group; vcard:fn "The dream team";
            vcard:member :Alice, :Bob, :Charlie .
            :Alice foaf:name "Alice Accacia".
            :Bob foaf:name "Bob Brown".
            :Charlie foaf:name "Robert Crimson".</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      You can have more than one assignee group. You can have an associated
      project, with its developers, as well. All the developers mentioned will
      be available to be allocated to issues.
    </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      This issue tracker originally was basically a copy pf the functionality of
      Roundup https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup<em>(issue</em>tracker) a
      python-based configurable issue tracker we were using before for the
      group. Roundup is, for example, used for the python language itself.
    </p>
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>
      Currently (2019-09) there is no user interface tooling for guiding the
      user through the task of creating a new tracker. This would clearly be
      valuable! @@ link to issue. Help would be great in making that.
    </p>
    <p>Other use</p>
    <p>
      The current method of storing all the issues in one file works for small
      projects but clearly doesn't scale with size or time. A plan is to use a
      <code>issueURITemplate</code> to allow issues to placed in subfolders by
      date, or timestamp, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      A virtual tracker is a tracker which aggregates a view of several
      different tracker would be valuable, for example to aggregate all the
      issues I have been assigned to, whichever of the projects
